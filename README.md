# Snake
Python algorithm for an autonomous snake player.

Allows a user to play against the snake algorithm or let it run idly.

The algorithm uses an optimized path-finding algorithm to determine the best direction for the computer to move the snake at any given moment. When no clear path is found, the snake will efficiently wrap itself around the map until a path is found.

This program was written for a grade 10 computer science project in 2020.
